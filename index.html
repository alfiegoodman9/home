      <p>
        I began my career working with internal systems and product data,
        focusing on keeping information accurate, consistent, and
        well-structured. My role has since developed into a more digital-focused
        position, where I help manage our e-commerce platform, update website
        and product content, and support SEO and other digital improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, nopCommerce, Intact
        iQ, and basic image and video editing for web use using Adobe Photoshop,
        DaVinci Resolve, and Sony Vegas. Mostly self-taught, with a practical
        approach to problem solving and workflow improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new coding languages, creating digital content, problem
        solving, and finding practical ways to improve how information is
        presented online. Outside of work, I’ve been a Leicester City season
        ticket holder since 2013, and enjoy travelling, gaming, film & TV, and
        spending time with friends.
